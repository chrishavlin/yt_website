          <h1>Development</h1>
          <p>
            yt is developed completely in the open.  Our
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-project">project</a> on 
            GitHub contains the repositories that make up the 
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/yt/">source code and documentation</a>,
            and even <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/website">this website</a>.
            Since the documentation is in the source code repository, when you 
            download the source, you get everything necessary to submit 
            changes to the code or the docs.
            yt is released under the modified BSD license.
          </p>
          <p>
            We invite contributions of any type -- code, analysis modules,
            documentation, blog posts, and even enhancements for the website.
            Below are some hints on what to expect and how to get involved, but
            please stop by
            <a href="https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-dev.python.org/">the yt-dev mailing list</a>
            or <span class="yt_code">#yt</span> on
            <span class="yt_code">chat.freenode.org</span> if you have any questions.
            Additionally, we use <a href="https://slack.com">slack</a> as a communication platform for
            development discussions.
            Feel free to sign up and <a href="https://yt-project.slack.com/">try it</a> out.

          <h1>What To Expect</h1>
          <p>
            Contributions to yt go through several stages.  Once you've
            submitted a pull request, to the source code, the documentation, or
            even the blog, you will likely receive comments on it from
            developers or other individuals.  <b>Every</b> pull request gets
            reviewed, even those issued by developers that have been with the
            project for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            These comments might address stylistic issues, may request changes
            to the variable names, may suggest methods of testing, or may even
            suggest alternate approaches to solving given problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're grateful for every contribution, and we hope to hear from
            you.

          <h1>How to Get Started</h1>
          <p>
            Here's the simplest way to get started contributing to yt.  You can
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/yt/">fork</a> yt on
            GitHub, push some changes to your fork, and issue a pull
            request.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the documentation you can find an 
            <a href="https://yt-project.org/doc/developing/index.html">an outline</a>
            of how to contribute changes, but here are some handy tips and
            tricks:
            <ul>
              <li>Use a git branch to track where you are in your
              development.</li>
              <li>Push to your repository and issue pull requests from
              there.</li>
              <li>Add
              <a href="https://yt-project.org/doc/developing/testing.html">tests</a>
              and documentation for new functionality.  The tests
              <a href="https://tests.yt-project.org/">are run on every pull request</a>
              (yt-fido will let you know how your pull request does!)
              <li>If you get stuck or want feedback, drop by Slack, IRC, or the
              mailing list!</li>

          <h1>Community Directed Development</h1>
          <p>
            The process of designing yt is conducted through
            <i>consensus-oriented</i> and <i>code-driven</i> discussions.
            In the waning months of 2012, a process was somewhat codified for
            discussing major design decisions and strategizing about preserving
            and breaking backwards compatibility.  Large-reaching design
            discussions and decisions are described in "yt Enhancement Proposals"
            (YTEPs).  These documents are stored in a
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/ytep">repository</a>, they
            are discussed both on the mailing list and through the process of
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/ytep/pulls">pull requests</a>
            and they are meant to be living documents that reflect how and why
            changes to fundamental components of yt are made.  The current set
            of all YTEPs can be found at
            <a href="https://ytep.readthedocs.io/">ytep.readthedocs.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because yt is used for
            analysis and visualization by a number of individuals across the
            globe, we try to avoid breaking existing scripts and functionality
            without very good reason.  The process of writing, submitting and
            iterating on a design document can put overhead on the process of
            coding and hacking away, but we want to ensure that yt is a reliable
            basis for long-term and stable analysis.

          <h1>yt Community Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>The community of participants in open source
          Scientific projects is made up of members from around the
          globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
          experiences. It is through these differences that our
          community experiences success and continued growth. We
          expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines
          when interacting with others both inside and outside of our
          community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive,
          successful, and growing community.</p>
          <p>As members of the community,
            <ul>
              <li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and
                provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment,
                regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender
                identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In
                particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist,
                racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not
                appropriate.</li>

              <li>We pledge to respect the work of others by
                recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of
                original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit
                about how we want our own work to be cited or
                acknowledged.</li>

              <li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the
                community, and realize that including people with a
                variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to
                enrich our community. In particular, discussions
                relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
                programming languages, and so on are welcome, but
                these should be done with respect, taking proactive
                measure to ensure that all participants are heard and
                feel confident that they can freely express their
                opinions.</li>

              <li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them
                respectfully, paying particular attention to those new
                to the community. We pledge to provide respectful
                criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
                discussion threads resulting from code
                contributions.</li>

              <li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of
                the wider community and to respond to criticism
                respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that
                encourage productive debate and disagreement, both
                within our community and where we are criticized. We
                will treat those outside our community with the same
                respect as people within our community.</li>

              <li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the
              code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see
              violations of the code of conduct. We will take action
              when members of our community violate this code such as
              contacting confidential@yt-project.org (all emails sent to
              this address will be treated with the strictest
              confidence) or talking privately with the person.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>This code of conduct applies to all
          community situations online and offline, including mailing
          lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings,
          associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.</p>

          <p>The yt Community Code of Conduct was adapted
            from the 
            <a href="https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html">
              Astropy Community Code of Conduct</a>, which was
              partially inspired by the PSF code of conduct.</p>
