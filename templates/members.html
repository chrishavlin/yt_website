          <p class="lead">
            In September of 2014, a discussion on the yt-dev mailing list about
            project governance resulted in the development of a YTEP on the
            topic of
            <a href="https://ytep.readthedocs.io/en/master/YTEPs/YTEP-0000.html">project governance</a>.
            As an outcome of that, the community decided to establish a
            "membership" process, whereby individuals who had contributed in a
            significant way to the project were recognized and identified as
            members.

            Member since {{member['since']}}.
